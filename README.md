# React starter

My minimalistic setup for starting a React project.

# Includes
 - [webpack with HMR](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html)
 - separate dev and prod config
 - eslint
 - ES6/7 via babel
 - less
 - mocha + [chai](http://chaijs.com/api/)
 - coverage with [nyc](https://github.com/bcoe/nyc)
